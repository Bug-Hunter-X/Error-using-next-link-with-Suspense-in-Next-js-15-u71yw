# Next.js 15 - next/link and Suspense Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using `next/link` within a component that utilizes React's Suspense feature in Next.js 15.  The issue results in a runtime error, hindering the proper rendering of links.

## Bug Description
The error arises from an incompatibility between `next/link` and the Suspense context. The error message may not be entirely informative, making it challenging to diagnose the problem.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to the page containing the problematic component.  You'll observe the error in the console.

## Solution
The solution involves restructuring the component to prevent the conflict between `next/link` and Suspense. This might involve moving the Link outside of the Suspense boundary or using a different approach to lazy loading content.

## Additional Notes
This issue seems to be specific to Next.js 15 and the interaction between `next/link` and Suspense.  The exact error message may vary based on your project setup.
